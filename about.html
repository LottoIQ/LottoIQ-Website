      <h2>What Is LottoIQ?</h2>
      <p>
        LottoIQ is a smart prediction system built for everyday lottery players who want a better way to play. It’s not a random number generator. It’s an AI‑powered tool that tracks patterns, detects opportunity zones, and delivers picks only when they make sense.

      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <p>
        LottoIQ runs proprietary AI models trained on real draw data from multiple states. Our system detects “warming” trends, forecast windows, and payout patterns. When conditions look favorable, we send you picks. When the odds aren’t in your favor, we don’t.

      <h2>Why We’re Different</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>🎯 Predictions only when it matters — no filler</li>
        <li>📈 Real performance tracking (hits, near misses, ROI)</li>
        <li>🧠 Built-in overlays to detect and avoid cold streaks</li>
        <li>🔒 Transparent logic — no guesswork, no gambling hype</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
      <p>
        Some days, the smartest pick is <em>no pick</em>. LottoIQ is designed to play smart, not every day. You’ll never be told to play when the system detects risk or low payout probability. That’s what sets us apart.

      <h2>Where We’re Headed</h2>
      <p>
        Right now, LottoIQ is available in select states like Georgia and Florida. More states are being added soon as our Smart State AI (SSAI) system expands. We’re also testing a private club version for serious players who want early access, test numbers, and custom dashboards.

      <h2>Who's Behind It?</h2>
      <p>
        LottoIQ was built by a team of data analysts, developers, and basketball coaches who spent years working in high-pressure, high-performance environments. We know how to test, adapt, and win — and we bring that same discipline to every prediction.
